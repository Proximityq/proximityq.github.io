									<h1>My Story</h1> 
									<p>My name is Katie Schantz and I am a digital artist who enjoys using technology to craft visually captivating content. 
									In my more personal projects I enjoy experimenting with different mediums such as paint, photography, and collage. 
									I started out primarily as a self-taught photoshopper making textures for video games, but now am pursuing a Bachelor's of Art in Studio Art at The Ohio State University. 
									I am committed to expanding my creative boundaries and refining my skills. 
									My journey has been driven by a deep love for artistic expression and a desire to inspire others to embrace their own creative potential. 
									Art is my personal form of expressionâ€”my voice when words fall short. 
									Through my work, I aim to encourage others to recognize that everyone is an artist, whether they realize it or not. 
									Art has been a guiding force in my life, helping me navigate challenges and offering a sense of liberation during the darkest times. 
									My mission is to share the transformative power of creativity, helping others discover the solace and strength art can bring. </p>
